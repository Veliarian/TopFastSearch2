                        <p>Schizophrenia is a mental disorder which impacts 20 million people across the world. Though
                            it can vary when it comes to symptoms, this isn’t something that should be taken lightly at
                            all. If left untreated, the individual in question can be debilitated in a very serious and
                            scary way. This piece will speak about diagnosing the disease, potential treatment options,
                            and also signs one can look for if they believe schizophrenia to be an issue.</p>
                        <p><strong>Characteristics of Schizophrenia</strong></p>
                        <p>As mentioned above, the level of one’s schizophrenia can vary from person to person. Some
                            have much stronger symptoms, while others have more muted forms. All the same, there are
                            some specific traits to look for. For many, primary symptoms include delusions,
                            hallucinations, and strange way of thinking. One’s cognitive ability can be hindered —
                            particularly when it comes to understanding social situations. Additionally, there could be
                            present apathy in terms of wanting to finish goals as well as be expressive. The expressive
                            part comes from lacking motor skills (such as speech). Lastly, one with schizophrenia may be
                            suffering from poor sleep patterns and less-than-ideal hygiene.</p>
                        <p><strong>Diagnosing</strong></p>
                        <p>When diagnosing schizophrenia, doctors normally study the individual in question for
                            approximately six months. They want to see the consistency in terms of displayed symptoms.
                            If multiple symptoms continue to show, there’s a good chance the person has some sort of
                            medical illness. The quicker doctors can find this, the faster one can be on the road to
                            recovery. Normally, men develop schizophrenia at an earlier rater (teenage years to early
                            20’s). One normally won’t see schizophrenia within females until late 20’s/early 30’s. All
                            the same, some children in adolescence have even been diagnosed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Causes</strong></p>
                        <p>There are a number of theories as to why someone may be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Heavy
                            abuse of mind-altering substances can reportedly be a cause of later incidents (acid, magic
                            mushrooms, ecstasy). One’s brain chemistry could also lead to schizophrenia — as can one’s
                            environment. Some studies believe that malnutrition before birth could be a reason. Duly,
                            people with autoimmune disorders reportedly may be more likely to suffer from mental
                            illness. Lastly, there’s the genetic component. If a close relative has the disorder —
                            whether it be a parent or a sibling — one’s approximately six times more likely to inherit
                            schizophrenia compared to the average person.</p>
                        <p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
                        <p>Treatment options for schizophrenia vary. There’s not just one specific option with a
                            universal success rate. The base way to deal with this mental affliction usually involves a
                            combination of intensive therapy along with medicinal treatment. Some people living with
                            schizophrenia live in environments where care is offered 24/7. This includes teams of
                            nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, doctors, and other medical professionals.
                            Additionally, the more one can educate themselves on the disease, the better.</p>
